# Anomaly_Detection
This project implements an anomaly detection system for the Reddit social network using a hybrid Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Transformer architecture. The model learns normal patterns of connectivity in the Reddit community graph and identifies anomalous connections by attempting to reconstruct and predict edge relationships.
